This is an exercise project from https://7daysofcode.io. 
Challenge is very simple, every day a new assignment is given, and the programmer is needs to complete the task.

For each day I created a branch to picture my state at that point. Main branch contains all the merged code at the end of the challenge

Ps: Unfortunately I was not able to progress this example chronological due to work assignments, so I finished the challenge a few weeks after.
